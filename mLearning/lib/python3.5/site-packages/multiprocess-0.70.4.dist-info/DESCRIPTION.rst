`Multiprocessing` is a package for the Python language which supports the
spawning of processes using the API of the standard library's
`threading` module. `multiprocessing` has been distributed in the standard
library since python 2.6.

Features:

* Objects can be transferred between processes using pipes or
  multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.

* Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or
  (for simple data) shared memory.

* Equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in `threading`
  are available.

* A `Pool` class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker
  processes.
